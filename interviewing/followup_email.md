This can serve as a sample followup email if I want to reach out to a recruiter on LinkedIn after applying to a job.

## Sample

My name is [name]. I submitted an application for the [position] just now, and I wanted to follow up with someone on the recruiting team, and I found your email on LinkedIn. I think you will find my experience as a [current_position] at [current_employer] to be a good fit for the role, and I'm excited to hear more about the team!

I've attached my resume here, and my portfolio and my LinkedIn profile are below. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at [phone] at any time.
