# Questions to Ask Interviewers

This lists example questions I can ask interviewers at the end of an interview.

TODO:

- Consider splitting this into "questions to ask someone who will closely know my job responsibilities" and "questions to ask someone from HR / who has less familiarity with my day-to-day"
