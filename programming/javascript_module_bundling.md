[Anatomy of JS module systems and building libraries](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/anatomy-of-js-module-systems-and-building-libraries-fadcd8dbd0e)

- Make it Tree Shakeable. 🌳
- Target at least ES Harmony and CJS module systems. 👍
- Use Babel and Bundlers for libraries. 💄
- Use Bundlers for Core packages. 📦
- Set the module field of package.json to point to the ES version of your module (PS: It helps in tree shaking). 👻
- Publish the folders which have transpiled as well as bundled versions of you module. 🏭
