# [README Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

- README driven development (RDD)
- write your README first
- RDD is a subset of documentation driven development (DDD). by restricting to a single file, it prevents over-specification. it also keeps libraries small and modular.
- helps you think a bit about the project beforehand
- you write the README when you are most enthusiastic, resulting in higher-quality documentation
- makes it easier for people to argue now that something is written down
