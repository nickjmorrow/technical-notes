# Getting Better

## [How I became a better programmer](https://jlongster.com/How-I-Became-Better-Programmer)

- find people who inspire you, but don't idolize them
- ignore fluff
  - language syntax
  - library APIs
  - configuring build tooling
  - knowing how compilers work >> knowing ES7 syntax
- dig into past research
  - [papers we love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)
  - get good at extracting meaning from white papers
- take on big, uncomfortable projects
  - learn C basics
    - valuable to know why people complain about it
  - write a compiler
    - [super tiny compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler)
  - learn macros
    - scheme, lisp, clojure(script)
    - change how you see code
  - read "structure and interpreation of computer programs"
  - try a new language to have a new way of thinking
    - clojure
    - rust
    - elm
    - ocaml/reason
    - gos
    - scheme

## Pragmatic Programmer

- the greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak
- knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets
- learn at least one new language ever year
- read a technical book each quarter. the nonce a month.
- participate in local user groups.
- experiment with different environments (try linux).
- try different tools (IDE vs editor)
- subscribe to interesting publications
- once you feel comfortable with some language or bit of technology, move on. learn another one.
- process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things
- always respond to emails and voice mails, even if the response is simply "i'll get back to you later."
- foster an environment where it's easier to find and reuse exciting stuff than to write it yourself.
- tag bug fixes when you check the code back in after testing. run monnthly reports analyzing trends in the number of source files affected by each bug fix.
