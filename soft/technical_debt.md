# Technical Debt

## [Fix like no one's watching](https://overreacted.io/fix-like-no-ones-watching/)

- There are many things that can increase a project's "friction"
  - unit test suite is slow
  - don't trust deployment script
  - some abstraction is slightly incorrect
- this leads to things never getting done, because they don't seem important enough by themselves. friction killed them.
- some explorations could be for naught, while some could be wildly important, but you'll never know because of that friction
