# Expected Keymaps

## thoughts

### ctrl+key

ctrl+key for program specific

shift for reversal of action

### ctrl+shift+key

e.g. ctrl+shift converts "save" to "save+as" for ctrl+shift+s
ctrl+alt for an additional modifier, rarely used

### ctrl+alt+key

e.g. ctrl+alt+r to restart ahk script

some keys will not do anything until an additional key is pressed, which is good for program-specific actions
ctrl+k,

### alt+key

alt+key for global? like switching windows
