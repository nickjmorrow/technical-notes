# Github

## Profile

- add a professional picture, a short bio, and a link to your other relevant websites (linkedIn, resume)
- use @mention to link other repos the recruiter should notice. to your company, group,or other repos you manage
- include the url to your personal site
- link to relevant profiles
  - stackOverflow
  - codePen
  - Behance
  - dribbble
- pinned repositories should be my most impressive ones
  - don't care about bash profile
  - pin the top 3 repos you want the recruiter to view
- pin repos with relevant technologies
- remove useless forks
- clean up starred repositories
  - especially removal of devops / white hat repositories

## Repo Mindset

- Think of every project as something that will eventually be wildly successful as open-source
  - Keep commits clean
  - Make everything easy to understand
  - Recognize that all cut corners will need to be revisited before "finishing" the project
  - Use public producitivty tools (issues, projects) on Github to show professionalism
- A project's "end state" should be something that is legitimately stand-alone and can be picked up by other people. It should be deployed, have unit testing, have documentation, be in a portfolio, and maybe even have an article written about it.
