# Learn in Public

- create learning exhaust
  - blogs
    - it's ok to write a dev blog for just yourself
  - tutorials
  - cheatsheets
  - speak at meetups and conferences
  - ask and answer things on reddit
  - draw cartoons
  - make the thing you wish you had found when you first started learning somethingn
  - teach workshops
- make PRs to libraries you use
- clone stuff you like
- you're the greatest benefitter of this workflow. it's for you.
- try your best to be right, but don't worry about being wrong
  - if you feel uncomfortable or like an imposter, that's good
  - wear noobyness on your sleeve
- teaching is the best way to learn
  - talk while you code
- most developers are "dark". they don't learn in public. when you do, you look like an expert.
