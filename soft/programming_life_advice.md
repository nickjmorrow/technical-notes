# Programming Life Advice

[Don't end the week with nonthing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)

- Make sure something about your life is changing week to week. Make sure you're accumulating something.
- Prefer to work on things you can show
  - Write about what you learn
  - Prefer to work on consumer-facing products
  - After your portfolio includes something you can show off, your ability to sell your skills gets markedly better
- Prefer to work where people see you
  - Go to local meetups of technical folks
  - brick by brick (writing an OSS lib over a few weeks, writing a bblog post, months shipping a new project), the wall gets higher
- prefer to work on things you can keep
