# Want to Learn

### Coding

Ordered from small to large.

#### Attack MO

- Start with the small stuff to build up momentum
- Gradually flesh out and break down the larger stuff
- Think of everything as "I may eventually write about this"

#### Small

Should take a weekend.

- Keyboard shortcuts alignment
- CI/CD as a concept
- Travis CI
- Netlify
- Github Actions

#### Medium

Stuff that I don't really have a hook into yet, so hard to estimate how long it would take. Any of these could reasonably take 1-2 weeks.

- front-end testing
  - jest
  - enzyme
  - cypress
  - mocha
  - sinon
- graphQL / apollo
- webpack
- web components
- web assembly
- web security (owasp)
- gatsby
