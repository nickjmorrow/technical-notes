# Want to Learn

### Coding

Ordered from small to large.

#### Attack MO

- Start with the small stuff to build up momentum
- Gradually flesh out and break down the larger stuff
- Think of everything as "I may eventually write about this"

#### Small

Should take a weekend.

- functional terminology
  - monad
- advanced typescript
  - conditional types
- bash and unix commands
- authentication
  - cookies
  - local storage
  - jwt
- advanced react
  - performance best practices
    - memoization
  - testing
- progressive web apps
- chrome devtools (as an IDE)
- git internals / intermediate-advanced git, branching / repo strategies
- nodejs
  - streams
  - sockets
  - express
  - best practices!
- vim / aligning keyboard shortcuts
- ci/cd as a concept
  - then maybe expand into reading about top CI/CD tools, like travis ci, netlify

#### Medium

Stuff that I don't really have a hook into yet, so hard to estimate how long it would take. Any of these could reasonably take 1-2 weeks.

- front-end testing
  - jest
  - cypress
  - enzyme
  - mocha
  - sinon
- graphQL / apollo
- webpack
- web components
- web assembly
- web security (owasp)
- gatsby

#### Large

Would take 2-4 weeks.

- containers, docker, kubernetes
- networking
- low-level language (e.g. learn Rust or CPP or Go)
- compilers
- system design
- web graphics
- databases
  - execution plans
  - query tuning
  - physical joins
- foundational books
  - clean code
  - clean coder
  - refactoring
  - effective engineer
  - software craftsman
  - test driven development by example
  - building microservices
  - https://book.git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- Test Driven Development
- Domain Driven Design
- Behavior Driven Design
- Extreme Programming

### Removed / Deprecated / Changed Mind

- electron
- arduino / raspberry pi
- native development
- machine learning / data science fundamentals and implementations
  - random forest
