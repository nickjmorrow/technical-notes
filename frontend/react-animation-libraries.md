# React Animation Libraries

## css method

- use JS to change the className on an element to match different rules in a stylesheet, creating an animation.

## react-transition-group

- add-on component for a simple implementation of basic CSS animations and transitions
- developed by guys from ReactJs

- described as a set of components for managing component states (mounting / unmounting) over time
- RTG changes classes when component lifecycle changes
- small size
- 3 components: Transition, CSSTranstion and TransitionGroup
- wrapping a component in `CSSTransitionGroup` and providing a `transitionName` (like "example") will apply classes to elements (enter, enter-active, leave, leave-active)

## react-animations

- react-animations implements all animations from `animate.css`. simple to use.
- can create styled components to wrap other components with to apply animations using css-in-js
- to animate on scroll, see `react-animate-on-scroll`

## react reveal

- this is an animation framework for react.
- good for using animations on scroll
- import wrapper components from library

## tweenOne

- library that ant.design uses for animation.
- used by ant.design, made by alibaba
- seems a bit complicated from the examples
