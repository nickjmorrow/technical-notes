# Design Tips

## Overlaying text on an image

- Overlay translucent black on the image, use white text
  - Great for thumbnails, splash page
- Text in a box
  - Use a black or colored background, but just on the text. Like a highlight.
- Blur the image under the text. Can only blur the part of the image near the text.
  - Can use out-of-focus area of a photo as a blur.
- Floor fade. Put a vertical black gradient on the image so that it fades to black towards the bottom. Have white text at the bottom. Can add text shadow to build on effect.
- Scrim. Put an opacity box around the text. Kind of hard to explain, should google it if I ever really need to know about it.

## Fonts

- Work Sans. Not on google fonts yet. Modern and clean, just a bit of fun. Wide letterforms so it works at small sizes.
- Montserrat.
- Source Sans Pro.
- Plex
