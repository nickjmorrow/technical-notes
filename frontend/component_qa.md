# Component QA

[Component QA in design systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/component-qa-in-design-systems-b18cb4decb9c)

## Visual Quality

Component style should use appropriate variables from design system like color, typography, icons, space, and borders. It should meet the overarching visual guidelines (e.g. flat or minimalist)

## Sufficient State & Variations

It should have the necessary variations like primary, secondary, or flat. It should have the necessary states like default, hover, active, or disabled. This can depend on scope.

## Responsiveness

Does it incorporate responsive display patterns and behaviors as needed? E.g. if it's an AppBar, how does it look at smaller screen sizes?

## Content Resilience

Is each dynamic word or image element resilient to too much, too little, or no content at all? For tabs, how long can labels be, and what happens when you run out of space?

## Composability

Does it fit well when used with other components to form a composition? For tabs, how can they be applied with or on top of other components?

## Functionality

Do all behaviors (JS driven) function as expected? For responsive tabs, are gestures (sliding left and right) and menus (for overflow tabs) behaving correctly in varied device settings?

## Accessibility

Has the design and implementation accounted for accessibility?

## Browsers Compatibility

Has the component visual quality and accuracy been assessed across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE and other browsers?
